# Among Us Rig V1.0
TheCrinjeMasterJay's Among Us Rig

**Check out the channel!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIowLb6bRhrORsLBmUhNWXA"**

If this gets enough support, I will be willing to update it further!

Here's a demonstration :  https://youtu.be/Mt3Ai-OcozM

*Even though it is a 2D Rig, it is meant to be used in a 3D viewport. 2D Viewport capabilities are not tested.*

**If you decide to use it in your animations, please credit me, even though I will not report you. I would really appreciate if you do, but you don't have to. Just email(thecrinjemasterjay@gmail.com) and let us know before you use it without crediting us.**


# *IMPORTANT*! ⚠

* The rig only works with Blender™.

* **THE EXAMPLE SCENE REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE THE FREE TEXTFX ADDON(https://codeofart.com/text-fx/). I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE CREATOR OF THE ADDON IN ANYWAY.**

* When using the rig, you **MUST** change the *View Transform* from **Filmic** to **Standard**, (*Render Properties>Color Management>View Transform*) **In order to keep the correct coloring**.

* **To use this in a project, go to the project file, then *File>Append*, Locate AmongUsRigv1.0.blend(the rig you downloaded), and append the *Collection.***

**Last of all, I am not affilated with the Company INNERSLOTH, and I do not own the 'Among Us!' name in any way.**

**We have some great plans for this rig in the future, *such as customizable hats*, *suits*, *pets*, *maps*, and even a *FULL BLOWN ADDON!*** *But only if we get enough support and downloads. I do not make any money in this process(unless I monetize through YouTube™)*, **but I don't have much time and I would work more if people use it more.**
